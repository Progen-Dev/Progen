# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security vulnerabilities should **not** be reported as an issue on github because anyone can see this issue and use it.

On the other hand, Security vulnerabilities should be reported **as fast as possible**.

You can report vulnerabilities on the GitHub security tab or send a private message to the Bot Owner `ShowMeYourSkil#5698`.

Private Messages are only allowed if users are member of a common server (Guild).
In order to bypass that you can join [Progen's Support Guild](https://discord.gg/rPeBPkr).
